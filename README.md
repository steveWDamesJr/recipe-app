# Ruby on Rails Group Capstone Project - Recipe App

Hello Foodies! Recipe app keeps track of all your recipes, ingredients, and inventory. It will allow you to save ingredients, keep track of what you have, create recipes, and generate a shopping list based on what you have and what you are missing from a recipe.
